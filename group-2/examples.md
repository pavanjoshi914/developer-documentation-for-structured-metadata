# ðŸ›• Examples

To demonstrate the concept more clearly, I decided to create a simple prototype through which a visitor can play a song if they like they can buy a song. While buying a song during confirmation payment they get to know about the song name, artist, and song image(send as base64 encoded string, decode on Alby side).

After successful payment, a song gets downloaded into usersâ€™ local storage. ðŸŽ‰
