# ðŸ”¥ Use Cases

This new spec built over Bitcoin and the lightning network makes payment transactions more engaging, interactive and blooms to have numerous possible use cases.

The potential of use cases after implementation of this spec is vast as transactions no longer only hold details about the performed payment but also include structured metadata of the consumed objects.&#x20;

For instance, it allows users to perform actions directly out of the user's wallet, including:&#x20;

* Accessing the purchased digital content.
* Renewing the expiring subscriptions.
* Advertising products by passing information as metadata.
* Ask for donations with relevant information as metadata.
* Recollaterize open trades on trading platforms.
* Topping up gift card budgets.&#x20;
* Many more use cases are on their way.
