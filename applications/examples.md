# ðŸ›• Examples

To demonstrate the concept more clearly, I decided to create a simple prototype through which a user can play a song (one of the digital content), and if the user likes it, the user can buy it. While purchasing any digital content such as a song (in this case) using the website, in a confirmation payment dialogue, they get to know about the song name, artist, and song image(send as base64 encoded string, decode on Alby side).

After successful payment, a song gets downloaded into usersâ€™ local storage. ðŸŽ‰
