> A new future of Bitcoin transactions resulting into numerous usecasesðŸ’°



Many different specifications such as WebLN bought a better solution to the UX of lightning network and enhanced applications of Bitcoin.

ðŸ’» On top of this, many broad applications such as  â€”

* Instant payments via a web browser using Bitcoin Sats (eg. Alby)
* Tippings for content writers, podcasts and streamers
* Streaming sats
* Instant purchases on the Web and many more came into workingâ€¦

Transaction lists as we know them from our private bank accounts are often a simple list of transactions sorted by date. Each transaction has data like Sender, Receiver, amount, reason and date.

ðŸŒŸSimilarly, Bitcoin transactions hold only static data which doesnâ€™t include much more relevant information to look into. what if transactions can have additional information(metadata) such as  --

* Purpose of transaction
* What was bought with that particular transaction
* Accessing bought right out of the wallet
* Allow users to interact with transactions depending on the additional information each transaction will hold

Every transaction can store additional information in form of metadata which can make specifications such as WebLN more broad and applicative in terms of interactivity and extend the scope of the Bitcoin use cases in numerous ways building a different future for the lightning network and Bitcoin.

This specification aims to extend existing technology standards such as WebLN to enrich transactions with additional information as structured metadata so that transactions containing static data contain more meaningful information giving more interactivity to the transactions.
